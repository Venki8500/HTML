        <i>Planets of the Solar Systems:</i>
        <dt>Mercury</dt>
        <dd>Mercury is an extreme planet in several respects. Because of its nearness to the Sun—its average orbital distance is 58 million km (36 million miles)—it has the shortest year (a revolution period of 88 days) and receives the most intense solar radiation of all the planets.</dd>
        <dt>Venus</dt>
        <dd>Venus is the second planet from the Sun, and the sixth largest planet. It's the hottest planet in our solar system. Venus is a cloud-swaddled planet named for a love goddess, and often called Earth's twin.</dd>
        <dt>Earth</dt>
        <dd>While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.</dd>
